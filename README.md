    PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a simple Node.js web application that fetches data from an external API and displays it on a Bootstrap 5-styled webpage. The application demonstrates the use of core Node.js features like creating a web server, handling asynchronous API requests, and modularizing code. Additionally, the frontend is styled using Bootstrap 5 for responsive design and layout. The project architecture is simple, focusing on clean separation of concerns using modularized JavaScript files for handling server logic, API requests, and custom events.

Key Files:
index.js:

Creates the HTTP server using the built-in http module.
Handles two routes:
/: Serves the static HTML file (index.html).
/api/data: Fetches external data from the JSONPlaceholder API using axios and returns it as JSON.
Implements custom events to log when requests are received.
requestHandler.js:

Module for separating the request handling logic.
Responds with the index.html file or serves API data.
events.js:

Uses the EventEmitter class to create custom events.
Emits a "requestReceived" event every time the server gets a request.
nodejs_info.json:

A JSON file that stores information about the Node.js environment, such as Node.js version and application details.
script.js:

Client-side JavaScript that fetches data from the /api/data endpoint and renders it dynamically on the webpage.

BRIEF SUMMARY
 Installing Node.js and Setup
In this lesson, I learned how to install Node.js and initialize a project using npm. I also created a GitHub repository to manage the project versioning, ensuring proper tracking of changes.

Lesson : Server-Side JavaScript
I created a basic JavaScript file and ran it with Node.js, which demonstrated the ability to execute JavaScript outside the browser. This simple step helped confirm the proper installation and setup of the environment.

Lesson : Building a Simple Web Server
Using Node.js's built-in http module, I created a basic web server that listens on port 3000 and returns a "Hello, World!" message. This is the first real example of how Node.js can be used to handle HTTP requests.

Lesson : Understanding Modules in Node.js
I learned how to organize code by breaking it into smaller modules. The server request handler was refactored into a separate module, making the code more maintainable and reusable.

Lesson : Node Package Manager (npm)
In this lesson, I explored the npm ecosystem by installing the axios package to make HTTP requests to external APIs. This is crucial for integrating third-party services into Node.js applications.

Lesson : Asynchronous Programming in Node.js
I refactored the API call using async/await, which allowed me to handle asynchronous operations more cleanly. This pattern is key in Node.js for managing I/O-heavy operations like fetching external data.

Lesson : Event-driven Architecture in Node.js
Node.js is event-driven, and in this lesson, I implemented a custom event emitter to log messages when the server receives requests. This demonstrated how event-driven programming works, a core feature of Node.js.

Lesson : Building a Complete Node.js Application
This final lesson combined everything learned into a complete Node.js app. The app starts a web server, fetches data from an API, and displays it in a Bootstrap-styled layout. The app also handles errors and makes use of events, external modules, and async programming.
